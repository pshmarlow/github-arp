# Processors

This directory contains data processing modules that transform raw extracted data into meaningful insights.

## Overview

Processors take raw data from extractors and apply various algorithms and transformations to generate analysis results:
- Statistical analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Metric calculation
- Trend analysis

## Creating Custom Processors

To create a custom processor, implement the base processor interface:

```python
from analysis.processors.base import BaseProcessor

class MyCustomProcessor(BaseProcessor):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        
    def process(self, raw_data):
        """
        Process raw data into analysis results.
        
        Args:
            raw_data: Data from extractors
            
        Returns:
            dict: Processed results
        """
        # Your processing logic here
        return processed_results
        
    def aggregate(self, results_list):
        """
        Aggregate multiple processing results.
        
        Args:
            results_list: List of processed results
            
        Returns:
            dict: Aggregated results
        """
        # Aggregation logic
        return aggregated_data
```

## Available Processors

### DependencyAnalyzer
Processes dependency graphs to identify issues and optimization opportunities.

### TrendCalculator
Calculates trends and projections from historical data.

## Processing Techniques

1. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Mean, median, percentiles
   - Standard deviation
   - Outlier detection

2. **Graph Analysis**
   - Centrality measures
   - Clustering coefficients
   - Path analysis

3. **Machine Learning**
   - Pattern classification
   - Anomaly detection
   - Prediction models

## Best Practices

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Stream large datasets instead of loading into memory
2. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multiple cores for CPU-intensive operations
3. **Validation**: Validate intermediate results during processing
4. **Reproducibility**: Ensure deterministic results with same inputs
5. **Documentation**: Document algorithms and assumptions clearly
